# Chapel : A next generation HPC language
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Chapel** is a parallel programming language developed by Cray. It supports programming design philosophy such as object-oriented programming and type-generic programming, but brilliant feature is that it allows the programmer to easily express different kinds of parallelism in a portable way.
