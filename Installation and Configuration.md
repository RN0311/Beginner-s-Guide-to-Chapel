## Installation and Configuration
1) Download Chapel from ``` https://chapel-lang.org/download.html ```
2) Expand source-release using: ``` tar xzf chapel-1.16.0.tar.gz ```

If you are using a shell other than bash, see [quickstart-with-other-shells](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.14/usingchapel/QUICKSTART.html#quickstart-with-other-shells) else use :
```source util/quickstart/setchplenv.bash ```
5) ``` make ```
6) ``` make check ```
7) Compile an example program: ``` chpl -o hello examples/hello.chpl ```

Congratulations! You've compiled your first program in Chapel! :wink:
